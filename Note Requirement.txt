There are 2 users 

The solution comprises 2 folders 

- Shop Staff App  (uses  Sqlite )
- Manager App (uses  Sql server)

Both are Asp.net Core 3.0 using Identity Authentication System

- Staff handles transactions related to Customers, Expenses and Sales which are found in their respective 
table , displaying of products added via the manager App 

- Manager handles 
   - CRUD of Staffs
   - Inventory ( CRUD products )
   - Can View Orders with Sales coming from every shop 
etc 


Core Operations 

- Sales operation ( Shop App ) : when this happen, a record is created in shoppingCart and 
ShoppingcartItem and the quantity of products sold is subtracted from the inventory ( Product Table ). 


- Stocking/Updating of Products (Manager App) : Product Table handles this, a record is created and 
restocking some properties of product are updated including quantity available


NB : All the functions of the system are developed and tested Ok

** The 2 Databases have the same schema

TODO 

Synchronization of data in such a way that there won't be inconsistent data in 
both databases ( Sqlite tracking changes & Updating sqlserver and Vice versa ) 



There is a scenario where sales are made at a shop , and the shop has not sync with Manager App 
before Manager restock. This will lead to inconsistent quantity available in both ends 
if some checks are not implemented


The Key Data we want to sync  are found in the following tables

- Products Table 
- ShoppingCart 
- ShoppingCartItem Table

I can repeat the codebase for the other tables ( expenses , customers etc ) so i wil be glad if you can
Comment some key part of the code 


Thanks Boss
